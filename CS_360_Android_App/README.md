Event Management Android App
Project Overview
This Android application helps users manage their events and appointments through a user-friendly calendar interface. Users can create, edit, and delete events, receive timely notifications, and maintain a clear overview of their schedule.
Key Features
User authentication (login/signup)
Calendar-based event management
Event creation with date, time, location, and description
Event notifications
Event editing and deletion
Settings for notification preferences
User Needs & Requirements
The app addresses the need for simple event management while ensuring users never miss important appointments. Key requirements included:
Easy event creation directly from calendar view
Clear event visualization
Automatic notifications for upcoming events
Intuitive navigation and event management
Secure user data storage
UI Design & Features
The user interface was designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind:
Calendar view for easy date selection
Floating action button for quick event creation
List view of events for easy overview
Simple forms for event creation/editing
Settings screen for notification preferences
The UI success comes from following Material Design guidelines and keeping user interactions minimal and intuitive.
Development Approach
The development process followed these key strategies:
Database-first approach using SQLite for data persistence
Modular development of features (authentication, events, notifications)
These strategies ensured maintainable code and can be applied to future projects requiring data management and user interactions.
Testing & Functionality
Testing was conducted through:
Unit testing of database operations
UI testing of user flows
Real-device testing for notifications
Error scenario testing
This revealed several edge cases in date handling and notification scheduling that were subsequently fixed.
Innovation & Challenges
The main challenge was implementing reliable notification scheduling, especially after device reboots. This was solved by:
Creating a BootReceiver to handle device restarts
Implementing WorkManager for background tasks
The notification system demonstrates strong technical implementation:
Proper handling of Android Oreo+ notification channels
Efficient background task management
Reliable event reminders even after device restarts
Integration with system calendar and time functions
Future Enhancements
Cloud sync capabilities
Recurring events
Calendar sharing
More notification options
Custom event categories
